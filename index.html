                    <p > Hello, my name is Andy Ho. I was born in Saigon, Vietnam. I moved to Unites 
                        States in 2003. I was overwhelmed with new culture and language barrier.
                        However, through time I was able to adapt and get accustomed to the new country.
                        I graduated from UT Dallas with BS in Marketing in 2013. I recently received my 
                        MBA from Texas A&M Commerce in 2017. I am currently enrolled in Coding course
                        at South Methodist University.
                    </p>

                    <p> This is my first ever exposure to coding. So far, it has been a great experience.
                        I am learning and having fun writing codes at the same time. I am very excited to become
                        a full stack developer. There are so much knowledge to learn and my skillsets to gain. 
                        At times, the material can be challenging. It is pretty much like learning another 
                        language. However, I believe results comes with hard work and practice. 
                    </p>
